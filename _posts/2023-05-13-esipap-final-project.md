<h2 align="center"> Abstract </h2>
Proton therapy allows to decrease the risk of side effects during treatment to 12%, compared to 
conventional radiotherapy. [1]   
In this therapy most of the energy is deposited in a defined region where the tumor is located (known as 
the Bragg peak).With multiple Bragg peaks of protons, it's possible to control the deposited dose through all the volume 
of the tumor. However, a small angle difference at the beam source increases the probability to hit the healthy tissues 
and organs.   
To provide high spatial resolution and precise measurement of the proton beam position, an architecture 
based on three layers of semiconductor pixel detectors is proposed to increase beam control and reduce 
ghost tracks. Additionally, fast electronics and data acquisition technology must be used to record all the 
data accurately.  
Studying materials and configurations for the pixels to monitor the beam, minimizing the side effects and 
maintaining the proton therapy treatment.
