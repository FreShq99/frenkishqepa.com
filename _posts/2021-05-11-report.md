<h2 align="center"> Abstract </h2>
This  report  describes  the  path  our  group  followed  to  develop  a  wearable  fall  detection device based on an artificial intelligence algorithm.  We start with the description of theproblem, then move on to the preprocessing and feature extraction operations, followed bythe classifier and the results obtained.  More attention is given to the data processing steps.

<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
<H3> Why do you need a fall detector? </h3>
<p>
Falls are the second leading cause of death from unintentional injuries worldwide, and eachyear an estimated 684,000 people die from them globally.  Another problem concerns rescue:in fact, it can take hours before a person, perhaps fallen in a place without someone nearby,is rescued[1].  If a person is alone, it is difficult to prevent the fall, but it is possible to acton post-trauma rescue.  With this purpose, a wearable device has been developed that candetect a fall and automatically send a message to a selected person, asking for help.<p>
  
<H3> How can a fall be detected? </h3>
<p>
You want to monitor the movement of a person, so the most suitable sensors are inertialsensors, namely accelerometer and giroscope.  A very simple approach to detect a fall isto define a threshold, which when exceeded, results in the detection of the event.  One must take into account the inter- and intra-personal variability of a fall, so a simple thresholdmay not be fit for this purpose, because a person may fall the same way on two differentoccasions, but the signals collected are different (Figure 1).<p>

<H3> Development roadmap</h3>
The development process involves the acquisition of useful signals. These data come from the SensorTile.Box, a development kit distributed by STMicroelectronics. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - LSM6DOX - was used, which includes an accelerometer and a gyroscope, for a total of six degrees of freedom (three axes for each sensor).

</p>

The data was acquired via USB with the software \emph{SensiML Data Capture Lab}, allowing to build the dataset.When talking about artificial intelligence, it is indeed very important to have a large and varied dataset. For the goals set, 1503 signals were collected, distributed as in Figure 2.

The next step is the extraction of features, fundamental for a good training of the classifier. Then we can proceed with the development of the neural network, the classifier that allows to detect a fall. The last step is the deployment of the model on the SensorTile.Box and use with the connected app. A schematic of the development path can be seen in Figure 3.
