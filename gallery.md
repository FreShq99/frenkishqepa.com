## Disclaimer  
I use an optic microscope with available magnitudes of 100x, 600x, 1200x. I take photos with my phone, since I do not have a digital output for saving the images. I will not edit the photos to improve their quality, in order to keep them true to reality.<br>
At the end of the captions of every image, you will find the magnification. Enjoy this small world :)

## Display pixels
In the next three photos you can see how the combination of just three colors -Red, Green, Blue- are used in displays to create the colors you see on your smartphone. The smartphone used is the "Xiaomi Redmi 9" which features an IPS LCD Display.

## BJT transistor 
In the following two photos, is represented the collector of the npn 2N2222A transistor.

  <p style="margin: 0;"> With a 100x magnification I saw this square, different from the surrounding. Most likely it is not the silicon chip, but it could be a metallization. If anyone knows what it is, feel free to contact me on my mail shqepa23@gmail.com . 100x</p>
