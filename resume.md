### INTERESTS

- In my spare time I like to study Artificial Intelligence.
- During the last year of my Bachelor's degree, I started working with biological signal processing. 
<br/>I am currently learning to use this knowledge for implementation on embedded sytems.
- I like physics and literature on atrophysics. Still unsure if I want to keep this interest as an hobby though...
